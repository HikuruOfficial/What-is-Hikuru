What is Hikuru and what problem does it solve?

Hikuru is an ecosystem project that includes various services for interacting with the cryptocurrency market.

First of all, Hikuru solves the problem of time. Everyone is looking for a place to gather everything a crypto-enthusiast needs: from cryptocurrency and NFT analysis to blockchain analysis. And we intend to provide such a place in the form of our ecosystem.

You will no longer need to google and open multiple sites to find and analyse tokens, coins or find out at what price your favourite NFT collection was bought, what it is and what influential people are subscribed to it. 

On our service you'll find an event calendar that can be customised and you'll see what upcoming events are coming to market from a particular project. 

The notifications feature will allow you to receive notifications right on the site, you will be able to filter notifications by your projects and receive news about them only. There will also be a price notification system for NFT collections and coins - if, for example, you want to buy a cheaper NFT but don't want to monitor its price on the trading floor every minute, our notification system will do it for you, you will receive notifications when the price of your project decreases or increases.

Our ecosystem includes tools such as: 

1. Real-time prices of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
2. Full analysis of cryptocurrencies.
3. Chain analysis to track wallet status and assets on the wallet. 
4. Decentralised coin ratings and NFT collections.

Our ecosystem will include:

1. Wallet Tracking - DeFi's decentralised portfolio analysis platform on blockchain that allows users to track addresses and provides information on all wallets in the marketplace, allowing them to be tracked.

2. Hikuru Quest (Aleo blockchain) - a project can create quests and tasks for its community on the Aleo blockchain, thereby increasing community interest in the project with real rewards in the form of NFT or tokens on the Aleo blockchain and others.

3. Hikuru Passport (Aleo blockchain) - We are creating an onchain passport that will rank wallets based on their online activity and help a person to be social while maintaining privacy. Any project will be able to add a wallet discovery feature using our passport.

4. NFT Marketplace (coming soon on the Aleo blockchain).

5. Hikuru Wallet - decentralised Web3 wallet (coming soon on Aleo blockchain).
