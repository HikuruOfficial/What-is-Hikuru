# What is Hikuru and what problem does it solve?

Hikuru is an ecosystem project that includes various services for interacting with the cryptocurrency market.

First of all, Hikuru solves the problem of time. Everyone is looking for a place where they can gather everything a crypto-enthusiast needs: from analysing cryptocurrencies/NFTs to tools for working on the blockchain and selling NFTs. And we intend to provide such a place in the form of our ecosystem.

You will no longer need to google and open many websites - everything you need will be inside our ecosystem.

## Our ecosystem includes tools such as: 

1. Real-time prices of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
2. Full analysis of cryptocurrencies.
3. Chain analysis to track the status of a wallet and the assets on it. 
4. Decentralised coin ratings and NFT collections.
5. NFT trading.
6. Interaction with projects through a decentralised system

Read more about the projects included in the ecosystem:

1. **Wallet Tracking** - a decentralised DeFi portfolio analysis platform on blockchain that allows users to track addresses and provides information about all wallets on the market, allowing them to be tracked.

2. **Hikuru Quest (Aleo blockchain)** - a decentralised platform that allows developers and brands to create companies/quests and connect with the right communities, it allows anyone to discover the world of web3 and gain new knowledge about the project, thus increasing community interest in the project with real rewards in the form of NFT or tokens on the Aleo blockchain and others.

3. **Hikuru Passport (Aleo blockchain)** is a digital ID that uses valid credentials to verify user activity. It does not store personal information and ensures user privacy. It also uses open web standards to verify identity and can be used for verification on different blockchains, which increases the reliability and security of the system. Its use can help reduce fraudulent activities and provide more accurate user identification on the blockchain. Any project will be able to add wallet discovery function using our passport.

4. **News Portal** - A news portal that will publish the latest news of the cryptocurrency market.

## Coming soon

5. **NFT Marketplace** (coming soon on the Aleo blockchain).

6. **Hikuru Wallet** - decentralised Web3 wallet (coming soon on the Aleo blockchain).

## Additional tools:

On our service you will find an event calendar that can be customised and you will see what upcoming events are coming to market from a particular project. 

The notifications feature will allow you to receive notifications right on the site, you will be able to filter notifications by your projects and receive news about them only. 

There will also be a price notification system for NFT collections and coins - if, for example, you want to buy a cheaper NFT, but you don't want to monitor its price on the trading floor every minute, our notification system will do it for you, you will receive notifications when the price of your project decreases or increases.
